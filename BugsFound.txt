sanitizeAmounts: Filter payments where amount is NaN
	If NaN is given to the sanitize function, it will carry it forward into the following functions
	
sanitizeAmounts: Filter out invalid payment amounts given as strings
	If an amount is given as an invalid string "string", 
	it will be treated as NaN and fill fail as shown above
	
sanitizeAmounts: Filter empty payment amounts given as strings
	If an empty string is passed in the amount column, it will be treated as zero and passed throughout. 
	This could be potentially be expected behavior but would need confirming with product manager or an analyst.
