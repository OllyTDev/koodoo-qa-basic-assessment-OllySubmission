This was my submission for a basic QA assessment for a job I had applied for in 2021.

The project it's self was a single simple pipeline, that had no tests written apart from two basic tests and the idea was to see what a recipient would think about testing, rather than the actual code itself. As I did not have experience in writing JS, I used this an opportunity to try and become more familiar with Js as well as learning the testing framework the team was using. 

I sucessfully created around 12 tests in a few hours and found 3-4 bugs in the process.
